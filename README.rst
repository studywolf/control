============================================
Studywolf Control repo - walking branch
============================================

This is a repository to hold the code I've developed for
a walking demonstration, showing a specific use of the DMP control code.

Run run.py to see the demo.

Installation
------------

A final requirement is the pydmps library, which can be installed::

   pip install pydmps

NOTE: The arms have only been tested on linux and currently don't compile on Mac. 

Running
-------

To run the basic walking demo, from the base directory::

   python run.py
